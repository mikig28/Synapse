# WhatsApp Issues Analysis and Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on the WAHA service logs and code review, I've identified three main issues:

### 1. Only 4 Groups Loading (Expected: 21 groups from logs)

**Root Causes:**
- The WAHA logs show 21 groups in the `messaging-history.set` event
- Backend `getGroups()` method has conservative limits and aggressive timeout handling
- Frontend `fetchGroups()` might be using a low limit parameter (default unclear)
- The request might be timing out before all groups are fetched

**Specific Problems:**
- Line in `wahaService.ts:561`: `limit: Math.min(options.limit || 100, 30)` - **This caps groups at 30 max, but further limits to smaller batches**
- Line in `wahaController.ts:172`: No default limit specified, relying on service defaults
- Frontend `WhatsAppPage.tsx:472`: `api.get('/waha/groups?limit=10')` - **Only requesting 10 groups!**
- Frontend `WhatsAppPage.tsx:854`: `fetchGroups(false, { limit: 100 })` - Better but not called initially

### 2. Messages Not Loading in Frontend

**Root Causes:**
- Session state validation is too strict - requires 'WORKING' status
- The WAHA logs show the session status transitions but messages aren't being associated with chats
- Frontend has complex chatId normalization that might be failing
- No messages visible in the chat interface when a group is selected

**Specific Problems:**
- Line in `wahaController.ts:259`: Session must be 'WORKING' before any messages can be fetched
- Line in `WhatsAppPage.tsx:1177`: `fetchMessages()` is called but might fail silently
- The logs show `participant` field (e.g., "110342206136439@lid") but this isn't being used as the sender ID
- Messages exist in WAHA but aren't being retrieved or displayed properly

### 3. Contact Names Showing as Numbers

**Root Causes:**
- WAHA webhook messages show participant IDs like "110342206136439@lid" instead of names
- The logs show no "notifyName", "pushName", or "senderName" fields in messages
- Contact resolution is failing - names aren't being fetched or mapped

**Specific Problems:**
- Line in `wahaService.ts:273`: `notifyName` fallback chain doesn't account for missing data
- Line in `WhatsAppPage.tsx:820`: `fetchContacts()` is called but might be failing silently
- No contact name mapping is happening for the participant IDs
- The `contactName` field defaults to the phone number/ID when no name is available

## Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Increase Group Loading Limits

**Backend Changes:**
1. Remove the aggressive 30-group cap in `wahaService.ts`
2. Increase default limits in `wahaController.ts`
3. Add better error handling for large group lists

**Frontend Changes:**
1. Increase initial group fetch from 10 to at least 50
2. Add pagination support for groups >50
3. Show loading state more clearly

### Fix 2: Fix Message Loading

**Backend Changes:**
1. Make session state check less strict - allow message fetching in more states
2. Add better error messages when messages can't be loaded
3. Handle participant field properly from WAHA webhooks

**Frontend Changes:**
1. Add better error handling when messages don't load
2. Show empty state with helpful messages
3. Retry mechanism for message loading

### Fix 3: Resolve Contact Names

**Backend Changes:**
1. Fetch contacts separately from WAHA
2. Create a contact name mapping service
3. Resolve participant IDs to names in message responses

**Frontend Changes:**
1. Request contact data on initial load
2. Build and maintain contact name map
3. Display names with fallback to "Participant" instead of showing raw IDs

## Implementation Order

1. First: Fix contact name resolution (most user-visible issue)
2. Second: Increase group loading limits (functional blocker)
3. Third: Fix message loading (complete the feature)
