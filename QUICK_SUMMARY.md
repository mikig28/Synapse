# Quick Summary - Session Persistence Fix

## What Was Fixed
The News Hub page was repeatedly asking users to log in even after successful authentication.

## Root Cause
The `newsHubService` was incorrectly trying to get the auth token from `localStorage.getItem('token')` instead of using the proper Zustand auth store.

## Solution Applied
- Changed `newsHubService` to use the centralized `axiosInstance` from `axiosConfig.ts`
- This instance already has proper token injection via `useAuthStore.getState().token`
- Updated all API endpoints to include `/news-hub` prefix

## Files Changed
- `src/frontend/src/services/newsHubService.ts` (1 file only)

## Deployment Status
✅ **Ready for Deployment**
- Frontend-only change (no backend modifications)
- Build successful
- Low risk
- No breaking changes

## Render.com Configuration
Your configuration is correct! ✅
- **Backend**: Running on https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com
- **Frontend**: Running on https://synapse-frontend.onrender.com
- **Environment Variables**: All properly set (JWT_SECRET, MONGODB_URI, etc.)
- **Token Expiry**: 30 days

## Next Steps
1. Push branch to GitHub
2. Create pull request
3. Merge to main
4. Render will auto-deploy frontend
5. Test login and News Hub access

## Expected Result
- Users log in once and stay logged in for 30 days
- News Hub page works immediately without re-login
- No more "session expired" errors

## Testing After Deployment
1. Log in to https://synapse-frontend.onrender.com
2. Navigate to News Hub page
3. Should work without asking to log in again
4. Close browser and reopen - still logged in

## Rollback if Needed
```bash
git revert da8910ae
git push
```
