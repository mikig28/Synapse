# Reddit Posts - Why External Links Are Normal

## The "Issue" That's Actually Normal Behavior

When users see Reddit posts in the news feed with URLs that don't go to Reddit.com, they might think this is a bug. **This is actually normal Reddit behavior.**

## How Reddit Works

Reddit is a **link aggregation** and discussion platform. Most Reddit posts work in one of two ways:

### 1. **Link Posts** (Most Common)
- User posts a link to an external article (BBC, CNN, Daily Beast, etc.)
- The post title usually matches or summarizes the article headline
- Clicking the main URL takes you to the external article
- The Reddit discussion is available via a separate "Reddit URL"

### 2. **Self Posts** (Text Posts)
- User writes original content directly on Reddit
- The URL points to Reddit.com
- All content is hosted on Reddit

## What Our Data Shows

When you see:
- **Title**: "Musk Savages 'Snake' Trump Aide..."
- **URL**: `https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-savages...`
- **Source**: "Reddit (r/politics)"

This means:
1. ✅ A Reddit user posted this BBC/Daily Beast article to r/politics
2. ✅ The article URL is the original news source
3. ✅ There's a separate Reddit discussion thread
4. ✅ This is exactly how Reddit is supposed to work

## Why This Confused Users

Previously, our system labeled these as just "Reddit" without clarifying that:
- The **content** comes from an external news source
- The **discussion** happens on Reddit
- Reddit serves as the **discovery mechanism**

## Our Fix

We now clearly label sources as:
- **Display Source**: "Reddit (r/subreddit) → domain.com" 
- **Additional Info**: "Reddit post from r/subreddit linking to external-site.com"
- **External Link Flag**: True/False to distinguish link posts from self posts

## For Frontend Developers

Use the new fields to create clear UI:

```typescript
// Use these fields for better UX
item.display_source           // "Reddit (r/politics) → bbc.com"
item.reddit_post_info        // "Reddit post from r/politics linking to bbc.com"
item.external_link           // true if it's a link post
item.reddit_url              // Link to Reddit discussion
item.url                     // Link to original article
```

## Bottom Line

**This is not a bug** - it's how Reddit fundamentally works. Reddit users find and share interesting articles, creating a discussion around them. Our job is to surface both the original content AND the Reddit discussion that led us to discover it.
