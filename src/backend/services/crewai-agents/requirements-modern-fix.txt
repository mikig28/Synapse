# Core Flask and API dependencies
flask>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
flask-cors>=3.0.0,<5.0.0
python-dotenv>=0.19.0,<2.0.0

# Web scraping and HTTP requests
requests>=2.25.0,<3.0.0
urllib3>=1.26.0,<3.0.0

# HTML parsing and content extraction - REQUIRED for social media scrapers
beautifulsoup4>=4.10.0,<5.0.0
lxml[html_clean]>=4.9.0,<6.0.0
feedparser>=6.0.0,<7.0.0

# Social media scraping dependencies - REQUIRED for full functionality

python-telegram-bot>=20.0,<22.0  # Telegram Bot API

# News extraction and parsing
newspaper3k>=0.2.8,<1.0.0

# CrewAI and AI dependencies - MODERN WORKING VERSIONS
# Use latest CrewAI which should have the ResponseTextConfig issue resolved
crewai[tools]>=0.60.0
# Let CrewAI manage its own litellm and openai dependencies
# Don't constrain these - let the dependency resolver find compatible versions

# AI API clients
anthropic>=0.7.0,<1.0.0

# Advanced scraping tools (optional but recommended)
firecrawl-py>=0.0.8,<1.0.0
selenium>=4.0.0,<5.0.0

# Utility dependencies
python-dateutil>=2.8.0,<3.0.0
pytz>=2021.3,<2025.0

# SOLUTION STRATEGY:
# 1. Use modern CrewAI (0.60+) where ResponseTextConfig issue is likely fixed
# 2. Don't constrain OpenAI/LiteLLM - let CrewAI manage its own dependencies
# 3. If there are still issues, we'll handle them at the application level

# FALLBACK NOTE:
# If modern versions still have issues, we can:
# 1. Use older CrewAI (0.40-0.50 range) with compatible older dependencies
# 2. Mock/patch the problematic imports
# 3. Use alternative LLM integrations
