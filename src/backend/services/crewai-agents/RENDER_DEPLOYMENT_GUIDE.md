## 🔧 Render.com Deployment Steps

### 1. **Environment Variables (Already Set)**
Your Render service should already have these environment variables configured:

**Required:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key (alternative to OpenAI)

**Optional (for enhanced functionality):**
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` - For advanced web scraping
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` - For Reddit content scraping  
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` - For Reddit authentication
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - For Telegram monitoring

**System Variables (Auto-configured by Render):**
- `PORT=10000` - Service port
- `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11` - Python version
- `FLASK_ENV=production` - Environment mode

### 2. **Deploy Configuration**

Your `render.yaml` is already configured correctly:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: synapse-crewai
    runtime: python
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh"
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: "3.11"
      - key: PORT  
        value: "10000"
```

### 3. **Deployment Process**

1. **Auto-Deploy Trigger**: Your Render service should auto-deploy from the main branch
2. **Build Process**: 
   - Render will run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Fixed compatibility versions will be installed
   - All dependencies will resolve correctly
3. **Startup Process**:
   - `start.sh` will execute with enhanced validation
   - Import tests will verify CrewAI compatibility
   - Service will start on port 10000

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. **Health Check**
```bash
curl https://synapse-crewai.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "CrewAI News Research Service (2025 Compliant)",
  "timestamp": "2024-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX",
  "version": "2.0.0-compliant"
}
```

### 2. **Functionality Test**
```bash
curl -X POST https://synapse-crewai.onrender.com/gather-news \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topics": ["artificial intelligence", "technology"],
    "sources": {
      "reddit": true,
      "linkedin": true,
      "news_websites": true
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session_id": "compliant-crew-...",
  "message": "CrewAI compliant analysis completed",
  "report": "# Artificial Intelligence, Technology - Comprehensive Research Report..."
}
```

### 3. **Progress Tracking Test**
After getting a `session_id` from the gather-news endpoint:
```bash
curl https://synapse-crewai.onrender.com/progress/<session_id>
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Import Errors
**Symptom**: Service fails to start with import errors
**Solution**: 
- Check Render logs for specific error messages
- Verify Python version is 3.11
- Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt are compatible

### Issue: Version Compatibility
**Symptom**: ResponseTextConfig import error
**Solution**: 
- Fixed in requirements.txt with version constraints
- `openai>=1.0.0,<1.12.0` prevents breaking changes
- `litellm>=1.0.0,<1.30.0` ensures compatibility

### Issue: Memory or Performance Issues
**Symptom**: Service runs slowly or times out
**Solution**:
- CrewAI 2025 implementation includes optimizations:
  - `memory=True` for context retention
  - `cache=True` for performance
  - `max_rpm=30` for rate limiting
  - `respect_context_window=True` for efficient token usage
