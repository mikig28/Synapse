## Full News Scraper Status

**‚ùå Full News Scraper (`agents/news_scraper_agent.py`)**
- Requires additional dependencies: `beautifulsoup4`, `feedparser`, `newspaper3k`
- These dependencies are not available in current environment
- Would provide access to more RSS feeds and better content extraction

### RSS Sources Configured (Available with Full Scraper)

1. **TechCrunch** - `https://techcrunch.com/feed/`
2. **Ars Technica** - `https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index`
3. **Wired** - `https://www.wired.com/feed/rss`
4. **MIT Technology Review** - `https://www.technologyreview.com/feed/`
5. **VentureBeat** - `https://venturebeat.com/feed/`
6. **Reuters Technology** - `https://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/technologyNews`
7. **BBC Technology** - `https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/technology/rss.xml`

## Social Media Sources (Currently Simulated)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Reddit Agent** - Requires Reddit API credentials
**‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedIn Agent** - Requires LinkedIn scraping (complex/restricted)
**‚ö†Ô∏è Telegram Agent** - Requires Telegram Bot API credentials

## Hybrid Implementation

**‚úÖ Hybrid Service (`main-hybrid.py`)**
- Automatically falls back to simple scraper when full scraper unavailable
- Combines real news scraping with simulated social media
- Provides detailed status reporting

## How to Enable Full News Scraping

### Option 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install feedparser beautifulsoup4 newspaper3k lxml
```

### Option 2: Use Docker with Full Requirements
```bash
# Use requirements-full.txt instead of requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-full.txt
```

### Option 3: Enable Social Media APIs
```bash
# Add to .env file:
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Use (Current State)
1. **‚úÖ Use Simple News Scraper** - Already working with real data
2. **‚úÖ Deploy Hybrid Service** - Best of both worlds
3. **‚úÖ Focus on Tech Content** - High quality sources already active

### Future Enhancements
1. **Install Full Dependencies** - Access to more RSS feeds
2. **Add Reddit API Credentials** - Real Reddit data instead of simulation
3. **Consider Telegram Integration** - Real-time news alerts

## Integration with Synapse

The news scraper can be integrated with the main Synapse backend:

1. **Current Setup**: Service runs in simulation mode
2. **Improved Setup**: Use hybrid service for real news data
3. **Full Setup**: Enable all APIs for comprehensive coverage
