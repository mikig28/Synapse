# Minimal Working CrewAI Setup
# Strategy: Use only essential dependencies and let CrewAI manage its own

# Core Flask dependencies
flask
flask-cors
python-dotenv

# Essential utilities
requests
pyyaml
pydantic

# CrewAI - Let it manage its own dependencies
crewai

# Additional tools we need
beautifulsoup4
feedparser

# Note: We're not constraining versions to let pip resolve the best combination
# This is the simplest approach that often works
