# WhatsApp Group Monitor - Complete User Guide

## Overview
The WhatsApp Group Monitor is an AI-powered feature that automatically detects specific people in WhatsApp group images using face recognition technology. When someone you're monitoring appears in a group photo, you'll receive notifications and the images will be saved for review.

## How It Works

### üéØ Face Recognition Technology
- Uses advanced AI face recognition to identify people in photos
- Analyzes facial features, patterns, and characteristics  
- Compares group images against your trained person profiles
- Provides confidence scores for each detection

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Create Person Profiles üë§

**Purpose**: Train the system to recognize specific people

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to **WhatsApp Monitor** in the sidebar (Camera icon)
2. Click **"Add Person"** button
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Name**: Enter the person's full name (e.g., "John Smith")
   - **Description**: Optional notes about the person (e.g., "CEO", "Friend from college")
4. **Upload Training Images**:
   - Click **"Upload Images"** button
   - Select **3-5 clear photos** of the person's face
   - **Best practices for training images**:
     - Use different angles (front, profile, 3/4 view)
     - Include various lighting conditions
     - Ensure face is clearly visible and unobstructed
     - High resolution images work better
     - Avoid group photos for training
5. Click **"Create Person Profile"**

**Tips**:
- More training images = better accuracy
- Update profiles with new photos periodically
- Test with recent photos of the person

### 2. Set Up Group Monitoring üì±

**Purpose**: Configure which groups to monitor and which people to detect

**Steps**:
1. Click **"Add Monitor"** button
2. **Select WhatsApp Group**:
   - Choose from dropdown list of your WhatsApp groups
   - Groups are automatically synced from your WhatsApp
3. **Choose Target Persons**:
   - Select which person profiles to monitor in this group
   - You can monitor multiple people per group
4. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Notify on Match**: Enable notifications when person is detected
   - **Save All Images**: Keep all group images (not just matches)
   - **Confidence Threshold**: Set detection sensitivity (0.7 = 70% confidence)
     - Higher = fewer false positives, might miss some matches
     - Lower = more detections, might include false positives
   - **Auto Reply**: Automatically respond when person is detected
   - **Reply Message**: Custom message to send (if auto-reply enabled)
5. Click **"Create Monitor"**

### 3. Review Detection Results üîç

**Purpose**: View and manage detected images

**Navigation**: Click **"Filtered Images"** tab

**What You'll See**:
- **Detected Images**: Photos where your monitored people were found
- **Detection Details**:
  - Person name and confidence score
  - Bounding boxes around detected faces
  - Processing statistics

- Ensure file size is under 10MB
- Verify internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

**No Detections Found**:
- Check confidence threshold (try lowering to 0.6)
- Add more training images
- Ensure training images are high quality
- Verify WhatsApp integration is working

**False Positives**:
- Increase confidence threshold to 0.8 or higher
- Review and improve training images
