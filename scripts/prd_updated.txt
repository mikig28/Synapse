
Synapse Platform: Updated Product Requirements Document
Thank you for sharing your PRD for the Synapse platform—it's an exciting concept for a personal "Second Brain" that combines knowledge management, AI intelligence, project tools, and integrations into a unified life management system. I've reviewed the current features and statuses, and I appreciate the strong foundation in areas like user authentication, dashboard, project management, and various integrations. The partially implemented or not-yet-started features (e.g., intelligent search, full web capture, NLP) present great opportunities for expansion to deliver more value.

To help develop this further, I'll provide an updated and more detailed PRD based on your requests. I've incorporated your ideas for a "Docs Page" (for saving and semantically searching documents) and "Map Key Points" (for location-based saving and connections). I've also suggested additional features that I believe provide high value, drawing from best practices in personal knowledge management (PKM) and second brain apps. These suggestions aim to enhance user productivity, creativity, and personalization while keeping the platform intuitive and AI-driven.

My recommendations are informed by trends in PKM tools, emphasizing features like bi-directional linking, AI-assisted organization, offline access, and analytics for personal insights. For instance, top second brain apps prioritize seamless capture across devices, advanced search (including semantic and visual), and integrations that reduce context-switching.clickup.com I've structured this as a revised PRD with more granularity: sub-features, user stories, priorities (High/Medium/Low based on core value and feasibility), and updated implementation statuses where applicable. I've marked new or expanded features clearly.

If you'd like, I can dive deeper into any section—e.g., wireframes, technical specs, or user flows. What are your priorities right now (e.g., AI enhancements, mobile support, or specific integrations)? Also, do you have any constraints like tech stack, target users, or budget?
