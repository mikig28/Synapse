# AG-UI Crew Progress Integration

## Overview
Fixed the "View Crew Progress" feature by integrating it with the AG-UI event system for real-time updates instead of polling the backend.

## Problem
- The CrewExecutionDashboard was trying to fetch progress from `/agents/{id}/crew-progress`
- The backend was attempting to connect to the CrewAI service which was returning 503 errors
- Users couldn't see any progress in the crew execution window

## Solution
Leveraged the existing AG-UI event system that's already emitting real-time progress events during agent execution.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated CrewExecutionDashboard Component** (`src/frontend/src/components/CrewExecutionDashboard.tsx`)
   - Removed polling-based progress fetching
   - Integrated with AG-UI events using `useAguiEvents` hook
   - Now listens for real-time events:
     - `RUN_STARTED` - Initiates progress tracking
     - `STEP_PROGRESS` - Updates individual step status
     - `AGENT_MESSAGE` - Shows important messages
     - `RUN_COMPLETED` - Displays final results
     - `CONNECTION_STATUS` - Shows AG-UI connection state
   
2. **Enhanced Progress Display**
   - Real-time step updates with status indicators (pending, in_progress, completed, error)
   - Progress bar based on completed steps
   - Better error handling and display
   - Connection status indicator (AG-UI Connected/Offline)
   - Session ID display for debugging

3. **Added useAguiEvents Hook** (`src/frontend/src/hooks/useAguiEvents.ts`)
   - General purpose hook for listening to all AG-UI events
   - Allows components to react to any AG-UI event type

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates appear instantly as they happen
2. **No Polling**: Eliminates unnecessary API calls and reduces server load
3. **Better Reliability**: Works even if CrewAI service is down since events come from backend
4. **Richer Information**: Shows all AG-UI events including messages, warnings, and errors
5. **Unified System**: Uses the same event system as other AG-UI components

## How It Works

1. When an agent starts execution, the backend emits AG-UI events
2. The CrewExecutionDashboard listens to these events via WebSocket/SSE
3. Each event updates the local state to show progress in real-time
4. The UI automatically updates to reflect the current execution state

## Usage

The "View Crew Progress" button works the same way:
1. Click "View Crew Progress" on any CrewAI agent
2. The modal will show:
   - Connection status to AG-UI
   - Real-time execution steps
   - Progress bar
   - Final results when complete
   - Any errors that occur

## Technical Details

The integration uses:
- AG-UI event types from `src/frontend/src/types/aguiTypes.ts`
- AguiContext for WebSocket/SSE connection
- React hooks for state management
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
