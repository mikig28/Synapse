# System Manifest: Synapse - Automated Second Brain & Life OS

## 1. Project Purpose and Vision

Synapse is a web-based application designed to be a personal, automated "Second Brain" and comprehensive life project management platform. Its vision is to dramatically enhance user productivity by intelligently capturing, organizing, processing, and surfacing information from various sources, with an initial core focus on WhatsApp integration. Synapse aims to transform digital chaos into actionable clarity, proactively assisting users in managing tasks, ideas, projects, learning, and personal goals.

## 2. Core Goals

*   Significantly improve personal productivity and reduce mental overhead.
*   Create a centralized, intelligent, and automated system for managing life aspects.
*   Seamlessly capture information (starting with WhatsApp).
*   Intelligently categorize and tag captured information.
*   Provide robust tools for project management, task tracking, idea incubation, and knowledge consolidation.
*   Offer personalized insights and proactive suggestions.
*   Ensure data privacy and security.

## 3. Target User: "Alex"

A busy professional, lifelong learner, or creative individual overwhelmed by digital information, struggling with project tracking, and seeking a unified system to enhance productivity and focus.

## 4. High-Level Architecture Overview (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Capture Layer:** Modules for ingesting data from WhatsApp, Web Clipper, Email, Manual Entry, Mobile Quick Capture.
*   **Processing Layer ("The Cortex"):** Unified Inbox, Smart Tagging, PARA-inspired organization, Bi-Directional Linking, AI Summarization, OCR.
*   **Management Layer ("The Helm"):** Task Management, Project Hubs, Goal Setting, Calendar Integration, Habit Tracker.
*   **Intelligence Layer ("The Oracle"):** Personalized Dashboard, Smart Reminders, Weekly Review, Knowledge Discovery, Productivity Analytics.
*   **User Interface Layer:** Web-based, clean, intuitive, customizable, with powerful search.
*   **Backend Services:** API, Database, Authentication, AI/NLP services, Background Job Processing.

## 5. Key Domain Modules (Initial Identification - To be refined)

*   **Module_Capture:** Handles all data input channels (WhatsApp, Web, Email, etc.).
*   **Module_Organization:** Manages tagging, categorization, linking, and the PARA structure.
*   **Module_TasksProjects:** Core logic for task and project management features.
*   **Module_Intelligence:** AI-driven features, insights, reminders, and analytics.
*   **Module_UserInterface:** Frontend application and user experience.
*   **Module_CoreServices:** Backend infrastructure, database, authentication, APIs.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements Highlights

*   **Security & Privacy:** End-to-end encryption (where feasible), MFA, strict data handling.
*   **Performance & Scalability:** Fast UI, ability to handle large user data.
*   **Reliability & Availability:** High uptime, regular backups.
*   **Usability & Accessibility:** Intuitive, easy to learn, WCAG 2.1 AA.

## 7. Technology Stack Considerations (To be detailed in tech-stack-doc)

*   Frontend: (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
*   Backend: (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails)
*   Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
*   AI/NLP: (e.g., OpenAI APIs, Hugging Face models, custom models)
*   Messaging Integration: (e.g., WhatsApp Business API, Twilio)
*   Deployment: (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Vercel)

## 8. CRCT System Integration

This project will be managed using the Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought (CRCT) system.
*   **Memory Directory:** `cline_docs/`
*   **Documentation Directory:** `docs/`
*   Core files like `activeContext.md`, `changelog.md`, `module_relationship_tracker.md`, `doc_tracker.md`, `userProfile.md`, and `progress.md` will be maintained.
*   HDTA documents (Domain Modules, Implementation Plans, Task Instructions) will be developed.

This manifest will evolve as the project progresses.
