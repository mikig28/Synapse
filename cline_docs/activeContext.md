# Active Context: Synapse Project

## Current Status
- CRCT System Initialized.
- `.clinerules` created.
- `system_manifest.md` created.
- Currently in the process of creating other core CRCT files as per Set-up/Maintenance phase.

## Key Decisions Made
- Project: Synapse
- CRCT Memory Directory: `cline_docs/`
- CRCT Documentation Directory: `docs/` (to be created if not present, and then `doc_tracker.md` will reference it)

## Immediate Priorities / Next Steps
1.  **BLOCKED**: Initialize `doc_tracker.md` and `module_relationship_tracker.md`. The `cline_utils` directory (containing `dependency_processor.py`) is missing. This is required to run `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor analyze-project`.
2.  Once `cline_utils` is available, re-attempt `analyze-project`.
3.  Proceed with further Set-up/Maintenance tasks as defined in `setup_maintenance_plugin.md`.

## Open Questions / Items for Discussion
- Location/availability of the `cline_utils` directory and its contents.

## Relevant Links/Files
- `.clinerules`
- `cline_docs/system_manifest.md`
- Synapse PRD (provided by user)
