## Title
Fix: WhatsApp Group Image Monitoring and Auto-Save to Images Page

## Description

### Problem
WhatsApp group monitors were not detecting and fetching images from monitored groups. Images were not appearing on the images page like they do for Telegram bot.

### Root Causes
1. **Incomplete media detection** - Only checking basic flags wasn't catching all images
2. **Missing media URLs** - Not fetching full message details with `downloadMedia=true` parameter  
3. **No database storage** - Downloaded images weren't being saved to the `WhatsAppImage` model

### Solution

#### 1. Enhanced Media Detection
- Added comprehensive checks for images: type, mimeType, hasMedia, isMedia flags
- Always fetch full message details for any potential media with `getMessage(messageId, true)`
- Properly construct media URLs from WAHA API response
- Added extensive debug logging

#### 2. New Image Storage Function
Created `saveImageToDatabase()` method that:
- Saves downloaded images to `WhatsAppImage` model
- Links to the correct user
- Preserves all metadata (chat name, sender, caption, timestamps)
- Emits Socket.IO event for real-time frontend updates

#### 3. Integration
- Modified `processMediaMessage()` to automatically save images after successful download
- Works seamlessly with existing WAHA service on Railway.com

### How It Works Now
1. Polling checks monitored groups every 30 seconds
2. Detects images through multiple indicators
3. Fetches full message details with download URLs
4. Downloads image file locally
5. Saves to `WhatsAppImage` database
6. Notifies frontend via Socket.IO
7. **Image appears on images page** ✅

### Testing
- Send an image to a monitored WhatsApp group
- Wait up to 30 seconds for polling cycle
- Image should appear on images page with full metadata
- Works exactly like Telegram bot monitoring

### Files Modified
- `src/backend/src/services/wahaService.ts`
  - Enhanced `pollForNewMessages()` method (lines 3948-4090)
  - Added `saveImageToDatabase()` method (lines 2389-2472)
  - Modified `processMediaMessage()` integration (lines 2812-2826)

### Benefits
✅ Consistency with Telegram image monitoring  
✅ Automatic detection and saving  
✅ Complete metadata preservation  
✅ Real-time frontend updates  
✅ Comprehensive error handling  
✅ WAHA service compatible (Railway.com)
