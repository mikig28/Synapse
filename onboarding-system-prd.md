## Narrative

Sarah, a marketing consultant, discovers Synapse through a productivity blog and decides to try the platform. After registering, she's immediately welcomed with a friendly introduction video that explains how Synapse can transform her scattered digital workflows into an intelligent, automated knowledge system. The onboarding guides her through connecting her WhatsApp business account, where she receives client communications throughout the day. Within minutes, she watches as Synapse imports her recent conversations and begins organizing them by client and project topic. She then creates her first AI agent using a "Client Communication Analyzer" template, which she configures to automatically categorize incoming messages and flag urgent requests. The onboarding shows her how to search through her connected data using natural language queries, and she's amazed when she asks "What did John say about the campaign budget?" and instantly receives relevant message excerpts with context. By the end of the 45-minute onboarding experience, Sarah has successfully set up her basic workflow, created a few notes about upcoming projects, and scheduled her AI agent to run daily. She feels confident about using Synapse as her new digital command center and immediately sees how it will save her hours each week while ensuring nothing important slips through the cracks.
