# Active Context: Synapse

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Implementing the Cursor Memory Bank system to enhance AI-assisted development workflow for the Synapse project.

### Active Tasks
1. **Memory Bank Implementation**: Setting up the complete memory bank structure
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Creating comprehensive project documentation
3. **Development Workflow**: Establishing AI-assisted development patterns
4. **System Architecture**: Documenting technical decisions and patterns

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Setup (Current Session)
- ‚úÖ Created `memory-bank/` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Implemented `projectbrief.md` with core mission and requirements
- ‚úÖ Implemented `productContext.md` with user problems and solutions
- ‚úÖ Implemented `systemPatterns.md` with architecture and design patterns
- ‚úÖ Implemented `techContext.md` with technology stack and dependencies
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Creating `activeContext.md` (this file)
- ‚è≥ **Next**: Create `progress.md` with current implementation status
- ‚è≥ **Next**: Update `.cursorrules` with memory bank integration

### Project Discovery
- ‚úÖ Analyzed project structure (full-stack TypeScript application)
- ‚úÖ Identified key technologies (React, Node.js, Express, AI SDKs)
- ‚úÖ Documented architecture patterns and technical decisions
- ‚úÖ Established development workflow patterns

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Create `progress.md` with current development status
   - Update/create `.cursorrules` with memory bank patterns
   - Test memory bank structure with actual development tasks

2. **Validate Documentation**:
   - Review all memory bank files for accuracy
   - Ensure consistency across documentation
   - Add any missing technical details

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
1. **Development Workflow Integration**:
   - Test memory bank with actual coding tasks
   - Refine documentation based on usage
   - Establish patterns for memory bank updates

2. **Project Development**:
   - Begin implementing core Synapse features
   - Use Task Master AI for project management
   - Apply documented patterns and architecture

### Medium Term (Next Weeks)
1. **Core Feature Development**:
   - Implement knowledge capture system
   - Build AI-powered search and organization
   - Create project management interface

2. **System Integration**:
   - Connect frontend and backend systems
   - Implement AI service integration
   - Add transcription and ML capabilities

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Implementation
- **Decision**: Use the ipenywis memory bank structure
- **Rationale**: Provides comprehensive AI context between sessions
- **Status**: Implementing core files first, will expand as needed

### Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Maintain both memory bank and existing .cursor/rules
- **Rationale**: Memory bank for AI context, cursor rules for specific patterns
- **Status**: Integrating both systems for maximum effectiveness

### Development Approach
- **Decision**: TypeScript-first with strict type checking
- **Rationale**: Matches existing project setup and improves code quality
- **Status**: Documented in techContext.md, ready for implementation

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **AI Integration Complexity**: Multiple AI providers need abstracted interface
2. **Real-time Features**: Implementing streaming AI responses
3. **Data Architecture**: Designing knowledge storage and retrieval

### Development Challenges
1. **Memory Bank Learning Curve**: New workflow for AI-assisted development
2. **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping memory bank current with changes
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Ensuring architectural patterns are followed

## Context for Next Session

### What AI Should Know
- Memory bank system is being implemented for Synapse project
- Core documentation files are complete but may need refinement
- Project is a full-stack TypeScript "Second Brain" application
- Task Master AI integration is already in place for project management

### Important Files to Review
- All `memory-bank/*.md` files for project context
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for existing patterns
- `package.json` for current dependencies and scripts
- Project structure in `src/frontend/` and `src/backend/`

### Key Patterns Established
- TypeScript-first development approach
- React + Express.js architecture
- Multi-provider AI integration strategy
- Memory bank documentation system

### Continuation Points
- Complete `.cursorrules` implementation
- Begin actual feature development using established patterns
- Refine memory bank based on usage experience
- Integrate Task Master AI for ongoing project management
