# Active Context: Synapse

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Agent Execution Error Debugging - Improved Error Handling

### Recently Completed
- **Agent Execution Error Fix** (2025-10-01): Improved error handling for agent execution failures
  - Problem: Users seeing generic "Request failed with status code 400" when executing agents
  - Root Cause: Frontend showing axios error instead of backend's detailed error message
  - Solution: Enhanced error logging and user-friendly error messages in AgentsPageMobileFix.tsx
  - Changes Made:
    - Added comprehensive error logging to console with full error object details
    - Extract specific error type and message from backend response
    - Map error types to user-friendly messages (inactive, already running, service down, etc.)
    - Added status code and error type logging for debugging
    - Created detailed debugging documentation (AGENT_EXECUTION_DEBUG.md)
    - Created quick-fix guide (FIX_AGENT_EXECUTION_ERROR.md)
    - Created comprehensive summary (AGENT_ERROR_FIX_SUMMARY.md)
  - Error Types Handled:
    - agent_inactive: "Please activate the agent before executing it."
    - agent_already_running: "This agent is already running."
    - executor_not_available: "The executor for this agent type is not available."
    - service_unavailable: "The AI service is temporarily unavailable."
    - Authentication errors: "Your session has expired."
    - Permission errors: "You do not have permission to execute this agent."
  - Next Steps: Deploy and test, or use Chrome DevTools to debug without deploying
  - Most Likely Root Cause: Agent is inactive (needs to be toggled to "Active")

- **Mobile Agent Creation Fix** (2025-10-01): Fixed "Coming soon" issue on mobile devices
  - Problem: Phone users clicking "Create Agent" button saw "Coming soon" toast instead of wizard
  - Root Cause: Mobile fallback version (`AgentsPageMobileFix.tsx`) had placeholder toast messages
  - Solution: Imported `LazyAgentCreationWizard` component and replaced toast with actual wizard
  - Changes Made:
    - Added imports for `LazyAgentCreationWizard`, `LazyWrapper`, and `LoadingFallback`
    - Replaced "Coming soon" toast handler with `setShowCreateWizard(true)` (lines 354-357)
    - Replaced empty state "Coming soon" toast with wizard trigger (lines 412-415)
    - Added `handleAgentCreated` callback to close wizard and refresh agent list (lines 306-317)
    - Added wizard component at end of JSX with lazy loading wrapper (lines 449-462)
  - Result: Mobile users can now create agents exactly like desktop users
  - Status: ✅ Build successful, ready for deployment

### Previously Completed

  - Cache is updated when sending messages or loading history
- **Refresh Functionality**:
  - Separated "Refresh" button from "Load History" button
  - Refresh button forces server fetch with `forceRefresh` parameter
  - Added `refreshingMessages` state for proper loading indication
  - Refresh button shows spinning animation when loading
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Avoid unnecessary message fetches when selecting same chat
  - Use cached messages when available (unless forcing refresh)
  - Maintain message state across chat navigation

### Previously Completed
- **Edit Button Enhancement**: Improved visibility and accessibility of edit buttons in agent cards
  - Added prominent blue "Edit" button in EnhancedAgentCard header (always visible)
  - Added prominent blue "Edit" button in MobileAgentCard header (always visible)
  - Edit buttons now appear in multiple locations for better discoverability:
    - Card header: Blue button with "Edit" text (newly added, always visible)
    - Card actions section: Edit icon with "Edit" text
    - Mobile action bar: Blue "EDIT" button with enhanced styling
    - Mobile swipe panel: Large edit button in swipe actions

  - Troubleshooting tips
- **Navigation**: All edit buttons properly navigate to `/agents/:agentId/settings`
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support, keyboard shortcuts, and screen reader compatibility

### Mobile Detection Fix Details
- **Previous Issue**: Used `useIsMobile(768)` which only checked screen width
  - Problem: Modern phones (iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S22, etc.) have >768px width
  - Result: These phones showed desktop cards instead of mobile cards, hiding edit button
- **Solution**: Implemented `useDeviceDetection()` which checks:
  - User agent patterns: `/android|webos|iphone|ipad|ipod|blackberry|iemobile|opera mini/i`
  - Touch capability: `ontouchstart`, `maxTouchPoints`, `msMaxTouchPoints`
  - Screen size as fallback: `width <= 768`
- **Debug Info**: Added comprehensive debug panel (DEV mode only) showing:
  - Screen dimensions, touch support, user agent detection, touch points, component type

### Previously Fixed
- **Frontend Build Error**: Resolved missing accordion component import error
  - Created missing `accordion.tsx` UI component in `/src/frontend/src/components/ui/`
  - Added @radix-ui/react-accordion dependency to package.json
  - Implemented accordion component following shadcn/ui patterns with proper TypeScript types
  - Added accordion animations to Tailwind config (accordion-up, accordion-down)
  - **Build Successfully Completed**: Frontend now builds without errors in 19.60s
 - **Frontend Build Failure (2025-09-25)**: Fixed incorrect export/lazy import for `MobileMetricsDashboard` causing Vite/Rollup error
   - Updated `src/frontend/src/components/mobile/index.ts` to re-export default components as named exports
   - Corrected lazy imports in `src/frontend/src/components/LazyComponents.tsx` to reference `module.default`
   - Verified `npm run build` succeeds locally; only chunk size warnings remain
- **Previous Backend Fixes**: TypeScript compilation errors resolved
  - Fixed axios import issue in `locationExtractionService.ts` (changed from `import * as axios` to `import axios`)
  - Fixed undefined `now` variable in `wahaService.ts` (changed to `Date.now()`)
  - Removed deprecated `@types/axios` package (axios includes its own types)
  - Fixed incorrect `version` property placement in `whatsappBaileysService.ts`

### Recently Completed Tasks ✅
1. **Service Worker Analysis** - Identified problematic service worker fetch handling
2. **Error Handling Improvements** - Updated service worker to skip problematic requests
3. **CORS Configuration** - Added proper CORS handling for API requests
4. **Fallback Service Worker** - Created sw-fix.js to unregister problematic service worker

## Current Implementation Status

### Service Worker Issue: IDENTIFIED 🔍
- **Error Type** ⚠️ - FetchEvent.respondWith TypeError: Load failed
- **Root Cause** 🎯 - Service worker trying to handle requests it shouldn't (browser extensions, cross-origin)
- **Fixes Applied** ✅:
  1. Added protocol checks to skip chrome-extension:// URLs
  2. Added CORS mode configuration for API requests
  3. Improved error handling in fetch strategies
  4. Created sw-fix.js for emergency unregistration

### Technical Details
- **Service Worker**: Located at `/public/sw.js`
- **Registration**: Done via `usePWA` hook
- **Cache Strategy**: Network First for API, Cache First for assets
- **CORS Issues**: May occur with cross-origin requests to backend

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Updated Service Worker
Push the updated `sw.js` with better error handling to production

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Service Worker
1. Deploy `sw-fix.js` as `sw.js` to unregister and clean up
2. Remove service worker registration from the app temporarily

### Option 3: Clear Browser Cache (User Action)
Users can:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click on "Service Workers"
4. Click "Unregister" for the Synapse service worker
5. Go to "Storage" and click "Clear site data"

## Authentication Status
- Backend is running and accessible
- User needs to be logged in to access AI Agents page
- 401 errors are expected for unauthenticated requests

## Next Steps

### For Immediate Fix
1. Deploy the updated service worker with error handling
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining errors
3. Consider implementing service worker versioning

### For Long-term Solution
1. Implement proper service worker update strategy
2. Add feature flags to enable/disable service worker
3. Improve error reporting from service worker
4. Add service worker health checks
