### Recently Completed Tasks ‚úÖ
1. **Service Worker Analysis** - Identified problematic service worker fetch handling
2. **Error Handling Improvements** - Updated service worker to skip problematic requests
3. **CORS Configuration** - Added proper CORS handling for API requests
4. **Fallback Service Worker** - Created sw-fix.js to unregister problematic service worker

## Current Implementation Status

### Service Worker Issue: IDENTIFIED üîç
- **Error Type** ‚ö†Ô∏è - FetchEvent.respondWith TypeError: Load failed
- **Root Cause** üéØ - Service worker trying to handle requests it shouldn't (browser extensions, cross-origin)
- **Fixes Applied** ‚úÖ:
  1. Added protocol checks to skip chrome-extension:// URLs
  2. Added CORS mode configuration for API requests
  3. Improved error handling in fetch strategies
  4. Created sw-fix.js for emergency unregistration

### Technical Details
- **Service Worker**: Located at `/public/sw.js`
- **Registration**: Done via `usePWA` hook
- **Cache Strategy**: Network First for API, Cache First for assets
- **CORS Issues**: May occur with cross-origin requests to backend

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Updated Service Worker
Push the updated `sw.js` with better error handling to production

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Service Worker
1. Deploy `sw-fix.js` as `sw.js` to unregister and clean up
2. Remove service worker registration from the app temporarily

### Option 3: Clear Browser Cache (User Action)
Users can:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click on "Service Workers"
4. Click "Unregister" for the Synapse service worker
5. Go to "Storage" and click "Clear site data"

## Authentication Status
- Backend is running and accessible
- User needs to be logged in to access AI Agents page
- 401 errors are expected for unauthenticated requests

## Next Steps

### For Immediate Fix
1. Deploy the updated service worker with error handling
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining errors
3. Consider implementing service worker versioning

### For Long-term Solution
1. Implement proper service worker update strategy
2. Add feature flags to enable/disable service worker
3. Improve error reporting from service worker
4. Add service worker health checks
