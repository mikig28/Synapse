## Previous Work (AG-UI System)

### AG-UI System: FIXED ðŸŽ¯
- **SSE Endpoint** âœ… - Improved with better error handling and production compatibility
- **Connection Management** âœ… - Robust reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Heartbeat System** âœ… - Prevents connection timeouts on Render.com
- **Error Recovery** âœ… - Graceful handling of connection failures
- **Progress Dashboard** âœ… - Should now display real-time agent progress
- **Event Handling** âœ… - Proper filtering and validation of AG-UI events

The AG-UI connection system remains production-ready and provides stable real-time communication between the frontend and CrewAI agents running on the backend services.
