# Active Context: Synapse

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Began Phase 4 (Polish) of the UI/UX enhancement plan by implementing a comprehensive set of Progressive Web App (PWA) features. The application can now be installed on user devices, works offline, and notifies users of updates.

### Recently Completed Tasks âœ…
1. **PWA Feature Implementation** - Complete PWA system for app-like experience
2. **Service Worker**: Caching strategies and update notifications
3. **App Manifest**: For app installation and branding
4. **Custom Hooks & Components**: To manage PWA state and UI prompts (install, update, offline)

## Recent Changes

### Phase 4: Polish (PWA Features Implemented)
- âœ… **Service Worker**: `sw.js` with caching and update logic.
- âœ… **Manifest**: `manifest.json` configured for Synapse branding, icons, and display modes.
- âœ… **`usePWA` Hook**: Custom hook to manage install prompts, update availability, and offline status.
- âœ… **`PWAPrompts` Components**: A suite of components (`InstallPrompt`, `UpdateNotification`, etc.) integrated via a `PWAProvider` to give users contextual prompts.
- âœ… **Vite Integration**: `vite-plugin-pwa` configured to automate service worker generation and manifest injection.
- âœ… **App Integration**: `PWAProvider` wrapped around the entire application in `App.tsx`.

### Phase 3: Delight Components (Completed Previously)
- âœ… **RippleButton**: Magnetic hover effects with click ripples, loading states, and glow effects
- âœ… **FloatingInput**: Animated form inputs with floating labels, validation states, and focus rings
- âœ… **ConfettiButton**: Achievement celebrations with physics-based particle animations
- âœ… **MorphingCard**: 3D transforms, flip effects, shimmer animations, and floating particles
- âœ… **CommandPalette**: Global search interface with fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, and categories

### Enhanced CSS & Animation System
- âœ… **3D Perspective Utilities**: CSS classes for 3D transforms and effects
- âœ… **Magnetic Hover Effects**: Smooth spring-based magnetic interactions
- âœ… **Advanced Keyframes**: Shimmer, pulse glow, float, and bounce animations
- âœ… **Performance Optimizations**: GPU-accelerated animations and reduced motion support

### Integration & App Updates
- âœ… **Global Command Palette**: Integrated with âŒ˜K shortcut throughout the app
- âœ… **Component Library**: All Phase 3 components exported and ready for use
- âœ… **App.tsx Updates**: Clean routing with page transitions and command palette
- âœ… **Memory Bank Updates**: Comprehensive documentation of all achievements

## Current Status

### UI/UX Development: PHASE 3 COMPLETE ðŸŽ‰
- **Phase 1: Foundation** âœ… - Design system, components, theming
- **Phase 2: Core Experience** âœ… - Navigation, transitions, basic animations
