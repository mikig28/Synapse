# Active Context: Synapse

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Fixing AI Agents page error on production deployment at https://synapse-frontend.onrender.com

### Production URLs
- **Frontend**: https://synapse-frontend.onrender.com
- **Backend**: https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com

### Recently Completed Tasks ‚úÖ
1. **Production URL Discovery** - Identified production deployment on Render.com
2. **Backend Verification** - Confirmed backend is running and accessible (returns auth error as expected)
3. **Environment Configuration** - Created .env.production file with correct backend URL
4. **Build Configuration** - Verified render.yaml has correct VITE_BACKEND_ROOT_URL setting

## Current Implementation Status

### AI Agents Page: AUTHENTICATION ISSUE üîê
- **Backend Status** ‚úÖ - Production backend is running at https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com
- **API Response** ‚úÖ - Backend returns proper authentication error: "Not authorized, no token"
- **Frontend Configuration** ‚úÖ - Environment variables properly set in render.yaml
- **Root Cause** üéØ - User needs to be authenticated to access the AI Agents page
- **Error Boundary** ‚úÖ - Working correctly, showing user-friendly error message

### Technical Details
- **Backend API**: Accessible at https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com/api/v1/agents
- **Authentication**: JWT-based, requires Bearer token in Authorization header
- **CORS**: Backend configured to accept requests from https://synapse-frontend.onrender.com
- **Environment Variables**: Set correctly in render.yaml for production build

## Resolution

The "Something went wrong" error is actually the expected behavior when:
1. User is not logged in (no JWT token)
2. Backend returns 401 Unauthorized
3. Axios interceptor catches the 401 and logs out the user
4. ErrorBoundary displays the error message

### To Fix This Issue, User Should:
1. **Log in to the application** at https://synapse-frontend.onrender.com/login
2. **Ensure valid JWT token** is stored in the auth store
3. **Navigate to AI Agents page** - it should now load properly

### If Login Doesn't Work:
1. Check if user registration is working
2. Verify MongoDB connection on backend (check Render logs)
3. Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in backend environment variables

## Next Steps

### For Developers
1. Add better error messages to distinguish between:
   - Network errors (backend down)
   - Authentication errors (need to log in)
   - Authorization errors (insufficient permissions)
2. Consider adding a redirect to login page for 401 errors
3. Add loading states while checking authentication

### For Users
1. Log in to the application first
2. If login fails, contact support or check backend logs
3. Ensure cookies/localStorage are enabled for token storage
