# Active Context: Synapse

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Enhancing the UI/UX of the Synapse platform following the comprehensive improvement plan, currently implementing Phase 2 (Core Experience) features.

### Active Tasks
1. **UI/UX Phase 2 Implementation**: Completed core experience enhancements
2. **Animation System**: Implementing Framer Motion animations throughout the app
3. **Component Enhancement**: Creating reusable animated components
4. **Design System**: Applying glass morphism and modern design patterns

## Recent Changes

### UI/UX Phase 2 Completion (Current Session)
- ✅ Created `PageTransition` component for smooth page transitions
- ✅ Implemented `AnimatedNavigation` with glass morphism effects
- ✅ Built `AnimatedDashboardCard` with spring animations and hover effects
- ✅ Created `HeroSection` with particle effects and gradient animations
- ✅ Integrated page transitions into App.tsx router
- ✅ Enhanced Dashboard with new animated components
- ✅ Created animation components export index
- ✅ Updated memory bank to reflect progress

### Project Discovery
- ✅ Analyzed existing UI components and structure
- ✅ Identified enhancement opportunities following the plan
- ✅ Documented UI/UX implementation phases
- ✅ Established animation patterns and design system

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Phase 3: Delight Features**:
   - Implement advanced micro-interactions
   - Add gesture controls for mobile
   - Create 3D visual effects with React Three Fiber
   - Implement sound effects (optional)

2. **Component Enhancements**:
   - Add ripple effects to buttons
   - Implement magnetic hover effects
   - Create animated form components
   - Add confetti for achievements

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
1. **Phase 4: Polish**:
   - Performance optimization for animations
   - Accessibility audit and improvements
   - PWA features implementation
   - User testing and feedback

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Start implementing API endpoints
   - Set up authentication system
   - Configure database solution
   - Create data models

### Medium Term (Next Weeks)
1. **Core Feature Development**:
   - Implement knowledge capture system
   - Build AI-powered search and organization
   - Create project management interface
   - Add real-time collaboration features

2. **System Integration**:
   - Connect frontend and backend systems
   - Implement AI service integration
   - Add transcription and ML capabilities
   - Set up monitoring and analytics

## Active Decisions

### UI/UX Implementation Strategy
- **Decision**: Follow phased approach from UI_UX_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
- **Rationale**: Systematic enhancement ensures consistent quality
- **Status**: Phase 2 complete, moving to Phase 3

### Animation Framework
- **Decision**: Use Framer Motion for all animations
- **Rationale**: Powerful, performant, and great developer experience
- **Status**: Integrated and working well

### Design System
- **Decision**: Glass morphism with modern gradients and effects
- **Rationale**: Creates stunning, modern visual experience
- **Status**: Implemented in CSS and components

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Performance**: Ensuring 60fps animations on all devices
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Glass effects in older browsers
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch gestures and performance

### Development Challenges
1. **Component Complexity**: Balancing features with maintainability
2. **Animation Timing**: Coordinating multiple animated elements
3. **State Management**: Managing animation states efficiently

## Context for Next Session

### What AI Should Know
- UI/UX Phase 2 is complete with core animations implemented
- Design system is established with glass morphism and gradients
- Animation components library is created and ready for use
- Next focus is Phase 3 (Delight) with advanced interactions

### Important Files to Review
- `UI_UX_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` for overall strategy
- `src/components/animations/` for created components
- `src/frontend/src/index.css` for design system
- `memory-bank/progress.md` for current status

### Key Patterns Established
- Framer Motion for all animations
- Glass morphism design language
- Component-based animation system
- Mobile-first responsive approach

### Continuation Points
- Begin Phase 3 implementation with micro-interactions
- Add gesture controls for mobile experience
- Implement 3D effects with React Three Fiber
- Start backend API development in parallel
