# Product Context: Synapse

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Modern knowledge workers face several critical challenges:
- **Information Overload**: Drowning in notes, documents, tasks, and digital artifacts
- **Knowledge Silos**: Information trapped in different apps and formats
- **Context Switching**: Constant jumping between tools disrupts flow and productivity
- **Memory Limitations**: Human memory is unreliable for complex project details
- **Lack of Intelligence**: Current tools don't provide AI-powered insights and automation

### The Vision
Synapse aims to become your external brain - a unified platform that:
- Captures and organizes all your knowledge automatically
- Connects related information intelligently
- Provides AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Manages projects with context and intelligence
- Learns from your patterns and preferences
