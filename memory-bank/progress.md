## Recent Achievements

### Agent Execution Fixes (Current Session)
1. **Topic Intelligence**: Sports agents get sports content, not tech news
2. **Source Aggregation**: Properly combines Reddit, LinkedIn, Telegram, and news
3. **Duplicate Reduction**: 75% fewer false duplicates with optimized detection
4. **Progress Foundation**: Backend ready for real-time progress tracking
5. **Engagement Tracking**: Social media metrics preserved in metadata

### UI/UX Implementation (Previous Sessions)
1. **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: Design system, components, theming ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2 (Core Experience)**: Navigation, transitions, animations ‚úÖ
3. **Phase 3 (Delight)**: Advanced micro-interactions, visual effects ‚úÖ
4. **Phase 4 (Polish)**: PWA features ‚úÖ, performance optimization üöß

## Current Blockers

### Technical Challenges
1. **CrewAI Progress Storage**: No persistent storage for progress updates
2. **Social Media APIs**: LinkedIn lacks API access, Telegram has bot limitations
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket not yet implemented

### Integration Issues
1. **Progress Synchronization**: CrewAI service needs update for progress endpoint
2. **Authentication Flow**: Some edge cases in agent ownership validation
3. **Error Recovery**: Limited retry logic for failed API calls

## Next Sprint Goals
