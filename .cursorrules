ws# Cursor Memory Bank Rules for Synapse

## Memory Bank System

I am Cursor, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

### Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files in the `memory-bank/` directory:

1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document that shapes all other files
2. **productContext.md** - Why this project exists and what problems it solves
3. **systemPatterns.md** - System architecture and key technical decisions
4. **techContext.md** - Technologies used, dependencies, and development setup
5. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
6. **progress.md** - What works, what's left to build, and current status

### Core Workflow Rules

#### At Session Start (REQUIRED)
- ALWAYS read ALL memory bank files before any work
- Check `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for specific patterns
- Review `activeContext.md` for current focus
- Check `progress.md` for implementation status

#### During Development
- Apply patterns from `systemPatterns.md` consistently
- Follow tech stack from `techContext.md`
- Respect constraints from `projectbrief.md`
- Update `activeContext.md` when context changes significantly

#### Memory Bank Updates
Update memory bank when:
- Discovering new project patterns
- After implementing significant changes
- When user requests "update memory bank" (MUST review ALL files)
- When context needs clarification

## Synapse Project Context

### Core Mission
Synapse is a revolutionary, fully web-based application designed to function as a personal, automated "Second Brain" and comprehensive life project management platform.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express.js
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude SDK + OpenAI SDK
- **Development**: Task Master AI integration, MCP server
- **Architecture**: Full-stack monorepo with Python components

### Key Patterns

#### TypeScript Development
- Strict mode enabled - NO `any` types allowed
- Comprehensive type definitions for all interfaces
- Functional components with hooks pattern
- Explicit prop types for all components

#### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Standard React component pattern
interface ComponentProps {
  // Explicit prop types with documentation
  data: ComponentData;
  onAction: (action: ActionType) => void;
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ data, onAction }) => {
  // Hooks at top
  const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialState);
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleAction = useCallback((event: Event) => {
    // Handle logic
    onAction(action);
  }, [onAction]);
  
  // Render logic
  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Backend Service Pattern
```typescript
// Service classes for business logic
export class ServiceName {
  constructor(
    private repository: Repository,
    private aiService: AIService
  ) {}
  
  async processData(input: InputType): Promise<OutputType> {
    // Validation
    this.validateInput(input);
    
    // Business logic
    const processed = await this.repository.process(input);
    
    // AI enhancement if needed
    const enhanced = await this.aiService.enhance(processed);
    
    return enhanced;
  }
  
  private validateInput(input: InputType): void {
    // Input validation logic
  }
}
```

#### API Route Pattern
```typescript
// Express route with proper typing
export const router = Router();

router.post('/endpoint', 
  authMiddleware,
  validateRequestBody(RequestSchema),
  async (req: TypedRequest<RequestBody>, res: TypedResponse<ResponseBody>) => {
    try {
      const result = await service.processRequest(req.body);
      res.json({ success: true, data: result });
    } catch (error) {
      handleApiError(error, res);
    }
  }
);
```

### Development Workflow

#### Task Management Integration
- Use Task Master AI for project management
- Reference existing tasks in `tasks/` directory
- Update task status as work progresses
- Create new tasks for discovered work

#### AI Integration Patterns
- Use abstracted AI service layer
- Handle provider switching gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for AI services
- Cache responses where appropriate

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries in React
- Typed error responses from API
- Graceful degradation for AI service failures
- User-friendly error messages

### Security Requirements
- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Environment variables for all secrets
- CORS configuration for API access
- Rate limiting for AI service calls

### Performance Standards
- TypeScript strict compilation
- Component memoization where beneficial
- Efficient state management
- API response times < 500ms
- AI responses < 30 seconds

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint enforcement
- Prettier code formatting
- JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints

## Project Intelligence Learning

As I work with this project, I'll discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone:

### Development Preferences
- User prefers direct, actionable responses
- Focus on implementation over explanation
- Anticipate needs and suggest solutions
- Value efficiency and expert-level communication

### Implementation Patterns
- TypeScript-first approach throughout
- React functional components with hooks
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access

### Common Workflows
- Memory bank consultation at session start
- Task Master integration for project management
- AI-assisted development with context preservation
- Comprehensive documentation maintenance

### Project Evolution
- Memory bank system implemented (current session)
- Focus on establishing solid foundation
- Planning for intelligent knowledge management features
- Integration of multiple AI providers for flexibility

## Commands & Shortcuts

### Memory Bank Commands
- "update memory bank" - Review and update ALL memory bank files
- "check context" - Review current activeContext.md
- "review progress" - Check progress.md for current status

### Development Commands
- Always start by reading memory bank files
- Use Task Master for task management
- Apply documented patterns consistently
- Update documentation as patterns evolve

Remember: The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy and completeness.
