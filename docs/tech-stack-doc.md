# Technology Stack for Synapse

This document outlines the proposed technology stack for the Synapse project.

## Frontend

- **Framework/Library:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Key Libraries:** 
  - State Management: [e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai]
  - UI Components: [e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, or custom]
  - Routing: React Router

## Backend

- **Framework/Language:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **API Style:** REST (Consider GraphQL if complex data relationships become a primary concern)

## AI/ML

- **Core Libraries/Services:** OpenAI API
- **Specific Use Cases:**
  - **NLP for Auto-Tagging:** OpenAI API (e.g., GPT models for classification and tagging)
  - **Voice Note Transcription:** OpenAI API (Whisper API)
  - **Summarization:** OpenAI API (e.g., GPT models with summarization prompts)
  - **OCR:** OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4 with Vision for text extraction from images; consider dedicated OCR tools if high-volume/precision PDF processing is needed)

## Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Hosting Platform:** [e.g., Vercel (Frontend), AWS (EC2, Lambda, Fargate), Google Cloud (GCE, Cloud Run), Azure, Heroku]
- **Containerization (if any):** Docker (Recommended for consistency across environments)
- **CI/CD:** [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins]

## Other Key Tools/Services

- **WhatsApp Integration:** WhatsApp Business API (via providers like Twilio, Vonage, or direct Meta integration)
- **Web Clipper:** Browser Extension (using WebExtensions API for cross-browser compatibility)
- **Email Handling:** [e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun (for sending/receiving at scale); Nodemailer (Node.js library for sending)]

## Considerations & Rationale

- **React (TypeScript) & Node.js (Express.js):** A popular, robust full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem offering strong community support, vast libraries, and good performance. TypeScript enhances developer experience and code quality.
- **MongoDB:** Chosen for its flexible schema, suitable for varied data types from multiple sources. Scales well for many use cases.
- **OpenAI API:** Provides access to powerful pre-trained models for a wide range of AI tasks (NLP, transcription, summarization, vision), reducing the need for custom model development for initial features.
