# Transcription Service Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
The transcription service was failing with the error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'faster_whisper'
```

This occurred because the main backend was trying to use a local Python script, but the required dependencies weren't installed in the deployment environment.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Configuration**: The system has `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_URL=https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com` configured, which should make it use the dedicated transcription service
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: When the API service fails, it falls back to the local Python script
3. **Missing Dependencies**: The local Python environment doesn't have `faster-whisper` installed
4. **Poor Error Handling**: The original Python script didn't handle missing dependencies gracefully

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Python Script (`src/backend/python_scripts/transcribe_audio.py`)
- **Dependency Checking**: Now checks if `faster-whisper` is available before attempting to use it
- **Better Error Messages**: Provides clear JSON error responses with suggestions
- **Fallback Models**: Tries Hebrew model first, then falls back to English model
- **JSON Output**: Returns structured JSON responses for better integration

### 2. Enhanced TypeScript Service (`src/backend/src/services/transcriptionService.ts`)
- **JSON Response Handling**: Can now parse JSON responses from the improved Python script
- **Better Error Reporting**: Logs suggestions and fallback options from Python script
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still works with plain text responses for compatibility

### 3. Installation Script (`src/backend/install_python_deps.sh`)
- **Easy Setup**: Simple script to install Python dependencies
- **Validation**: Checks for Python and pip availability
- **Testing Instructions**: Provides commands to test the installation

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Use the Dedicated Transcription Service (Recommended)
Since you already have `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_URL` configured, the system should be using the dedicated service. If it's still failing:

1. **Check Service Status**:
   ```bash
   curl https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com/health
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variable**: Ensure your deployment has the correct environment variable set

3. **Check Logs**: Look for API connection errors in your main backend logs

### Option 2: Install Python Dependencies Locally
If you want the local fallback to work:

1. **Run the installation script**:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   chmod +x install_python_deps.sh
   ./install_python_deps.sh
   ```

2. **Or install manually**:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Option 3: Quick Environment Fix
Add this to your deployment environment variables:
```
TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_URL=https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test the Dedicated Service
```bash
curl -X POST "https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com/transcribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your_audio_file.oga"
```

### 2. Test Local Python Script (if dependencies installed)
```bash
cd src/backend
python python_scripts/transcribe_audio.py path/to/audio/file.oga
```

### 3. Test Integration
Send a voice message through your Telegram bot and check the logs.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### If Using Dedicated Service (Recommended)
```
[TranscriptionService]: Using API service at https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com
[TranscriptionService]: Transcription successful via API
```

### If Using Local Script (with dependencies installed)
```
[TranscriptionService]: Using local Python script
[TranscriptionService]: Transcription successful via local Python script
```

### If Dependencies Missing (Graceful Failure)
```
[TranscriptionService]: Python script returned error: Missing dependency: No module named 'faster_whisper'
[TranscriptionService]: Suggestion: Please install faster-whisper: pip install faster-whisper
```

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Production
1. **Use the dedicated transcription service** - it's more reliable and scalable
2. **Set environment variable**: `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_URL=https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com`
3. **Monitor service health**: Regularly check the `/health` endpoint

### For Development
1. **Install Python dependencies** for local testing
2. **Use the installation script** provided
3. **Test both API and local fallback** scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your backend service** to pick up the improved error handling
2. **Test with a voice message** to see if it now uses the dedicated service
3. **Check the logs** to confirm which transcription method is being used
4. **If still having issues**, run the health check on the dedicated service

## Files Modified
- `src/backend/python_scripts/transcribe_audio.py` - Improved error handling and JSON responses
- `src/backend/src/services/transcriptionService.ts` - Better error handling and JSON parsing
- `src/backend/install_python_deps.sh` - Installation script for Python dependencies
- `TRANSCRIPTION_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

The transcription service should now provide much better error messages and gracefully handle missing dependencies while preferring the dedicated transcription service when available.
