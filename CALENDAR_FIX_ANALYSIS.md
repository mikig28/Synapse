# Calendar Event Display Issue Analysis

## Issues Found:

1. **Event Positioning Calculation**: The `calculateEventStyle` function might be positioning events outside visible bounds
2. **Time Slot Range**: Events outside 7 AM - 7 PM might not be visible
3. **Event Filtering**: The `getSafeEvents` function was simplified but might still have issues
4. **Date Comparison**: Events might not match the correct dates in week/day views

## Quick Fixes Implemented:

1. Extended time slot range to show more hours
2. Improved event positioning calculation
3. Enhanced debugging to identify the root cause
4. Added fallback positioning for events outside visible range

## Debug Tools Added:

- "Log Events" button to see all events and their positions
- "Test Event" button to create a test event at 2-3 PM today
- Enhanced console logging for event filtering and positioning

Please test these changes and use the debug tools to identify any remaining issues.
