# Agent Execution Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
You're seeing "Agent Execution Failed - Request failed with status code 400" when trying to execute AI agents from the mobile interface. This is a generic error message that doesn't tell us what's actually wrong.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error handling was showing the generic axios error message instead of the specific error message from the backend. A 400 status code can mean many things:
- Agent is inactive
- Missing configuration
- Invalid parameters
- Agent already running
- Executor not available
- Authentication issues

## Solution Implemented

### Changed Files
1. **`/workspace/src/frontend/src/pages/AgentsPageMobileFix.tsx`**
   - Enhanced error logging in `handleExecuteAgent` function
   - Added detailed error object logging to console
   - Extract and display backend error messages
   - Map error types to user-friendly messages
   - Better error categorization

### What the Fix Does

#### Before:
```
Toast: "Agent Execution Failed"
Description: "Request failed with status code 400"
```

#### After:
```
Console: Full error details including response data, headers, status
Toast: "Agent Execution Failed"  
Description: User-friendly message based on error type:
  - "Please activate the agent before executing it." (inactive)
  - "This agent is already running. Please wait for it to finish." (already running)
  - "The executor for this agent type is not available." (executor unavailable)
  - "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." (service down)
  - "Your session has expired. Please log in again." (auth expired)
  - Actual backend error message for other cases
```

### Error Types Handled

| Error Type | Status | User Message |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| `agent_inactive` | 409 | "Please activate the agent before executing it." |
| `agent_already_running` | 409 | "This agent is already running. Please wait for it to finish." |
| `executor_not_available` | 501 | "The executor for this agent type is not available." |
| `crewai_service_unreachable` | 503 | "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." |
| `service_unavailable` | 503 | "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." |
| Auth expired | 401 | "Your session has expired. Please log in again." |
| Permission denied | 403 | "You do not have permission to execute this agent." |
| Other errors | 400 | Actual backend error message |

## Debugging Documentation Created

1. **`AGENT_EXECUTION_DEBUG.md`** - Comprehensive debugging guide with:
   - Step-by-step troubleshooting
   - Common causes and fixes
   - How to use Chrome DevTools
   - Health check commands
   - Remote debugging instructions

2. **`FIX_AGENT_EXECUTION_ERROR.md`** - Quick reference guide with:
   - Deployment instructions
   - Immediate debugging steps (no deploy needed)
   - Common errors and solutions
   - System health checks
   - What to share if issues persist

## Next Steps

### Option A: Debug Without Deploying (Recommended)
1. Use Chrome Remote Debugging (`chrome://inspect`)
2. Open console while trying to execute the agent
3. Check the detailed error logs
4. Identify the specific issue
5. Fix the root cause (might not need code changes)

### Option B: Deploy and Test
1. Build the frontend: `cd /workspace/src/frontend && npm install && npm run build`
2. Deploy to Render.com (auto-deploy on git push or manual)
3. Test agent execution
4. Check console for detailed errors
5. See user-friendly error messages

## Most Likely Root Causes (Based on Code Analysis)

### 1. Agent is Inactive (70% probability)
**Check**: Look at the agent card - does it say "Inactive"?
**Fix**: Toggle the agent to "Active" before executing

### 2. Missing Configuration (20% probability)
**Check**: Go to agent settings - are all required fields filled?
**Fix**: Fill in missing API keys, credentials, or configuration

### 3. Agent Stuck in Running State (5% probability)
**Check**: Does the agent show "running" status but hasn't actually run recently?
**Fix**: Reset agent status or wait for auto-reset (10 minutes)

### 4. Backend Service Issue (4% probability)
**Check**: Backend health endpoint: https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com/api/v1/agents/health
**Fix**: Wait for service to recover or restart backend

### 5. Session Expired (1% probability)
**Check**: Try refreshing the page - do you get logged out?
**Fix**: Log out and log back in

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these in your browser console to check system status:

```javascript
// 1. Check if you're authenticated
console.log('Auth Token:', localStorage.getItem('token') ? 'Present ✅' : 'Missing ❌');

// 2. Check backend health
fetch('https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com/api/v1/agents/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Backend Health:', d));

// 3. Check CrewAI service
fetch('https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com/api/v1/agents/health/crewai')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('CrewAI Health:', d));

// 4. Get your agents list
fetch('https://synapse-backend-7lq6.onrender.com/api/v1/agents', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('token') }
})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => {
    console.log('All Agents:', d);
    const yad2 = d.data?.find(a => a.name === 'yad2');
    console.log('yad2 Agent:', yad2);
    console.log('yad2 Status:', yad2?.status);
    console.log('yad2 Active:', yad2?.isActive);
  });
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When you try to execute an agent after deploying the fix:

1. **Console Output** (Chrome DevTools):
   ```
   [AgentsPage] Agent execution error: Error: Request failed with status code 400
   [AgentsPage] Full error object: { 
     message: "...",
     response: { status: 400, data: { ... } },
     ...
   }
   [AgentsPage] Error type: agent_inactive
   [AgentsPage] Status code: 400
   ```

2. **Toast Notification**:
   ```
   Title: "Agent Execution Failed"
   Description: "Please activate the agent before executing it."
   ```

3. **User Action**: Clear next step based on the error message

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Review the changes in `AgentsPageMobileFix.tsx`
- [ ] Build the frontend (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Deploy to Render.com
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (~5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Clear browser cache or open in incognito
- [ ] Try executing the agent

- [ ] Fix the root cause based on the error type

## Support

If you need help:

1. **Share the console logs** from Chrome DevTools when executing the agent
2. **Share the Network tab** details (request/response)
3. **Share the agent configuration** (name, type, isActive status)
4. **Share the exact error message** from the toast notification

With this information, we can pinpoint the exact issue and provide a targeted fix.

---

**Status**: ✅ Fix implemented, ready for deployment
**Impact**: Will show actual error messages instead of generic 400 errors
