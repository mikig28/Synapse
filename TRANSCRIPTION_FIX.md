# Transcription Service Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis
The transcription service was failing with the error:
```
ERROR:__main__:Error loading model: Unable to open file 'model.bin' in model '/root/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--openai--whisper-small/snapshots/...'
```

This indicates that the Whisper model files were not being properly downloaded or cached in the Render environment.

## Root Causes
1. **Model Download Issues**: The Hebrew model `ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2` was not being properly downloaded
2. **Cache Directory Problems**: Inconsistent cache directory configuration
3. **No Fallback Mechanism**: No backup plan if the primary model fails
4. **Missing Dependencies**: `huggingface_hub` was not included for explicit model downloading

## Complete Solution

### 1. Updated Application Code (`app.py`)
- **Added fallback model support**: If Hebrew model fails, falls back to `openai/whisper-small`
- **Improved model downloading**: Uses `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` for reliable downloads
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and error reporting
- **Cache management**: Proper cache directory setup and permissions
- **Health checks**: Enhanced health endpoint that reports model status

### 2. Updated Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `huggingface_hub==0.19.4` for explicit model downloading

### 3. Updated Dockerfile
- **Pre-download fallback model**: Downloads `openai/whisper-small` during build
- **Proper permissions**: Sets correct permissions on cache directory
- **Additional dependencies**: Includes `git` for model downloads

### 4. Updated Render Configuration (`render.yaml`)
- **Enhanced environment variables**: Proper cache directory configuration
- **Persistent disk**: 10GB disk for model caching
- **Build optimization**: Better build and start commands

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Redeploy the Transcription Service (Recommended)
1. **Push the updated code** to your repository
2. **Redeploy the `synapse-transcription` service** on Render
3. **Monitor the logs** during startup to ensure model downloads successfully
4. **Test the service** by visiting the health endpoint: `https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com/health`

### Option 2: Use External Service (Quick Fix)
If you want an immediate fix while the service redeploys:

1. **Add environment variable to your main backend service**:
   ```
   TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_URL=https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com
   ```

2. **Update your main backend `.env` file**:
   ```
   TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_URL=https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com
   ```

## How the Fix Works

### Model Loading Strategy
1. **Primary Model**: Tries to load `ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2` (Hebrew)
2. **Cache Check**: First checks if model is already cached
3. **Download**: If not cached, downloads the model explicitly
4. **Fallback**: If Hebrew model fails, falls back to `openai/whisper-small`
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and retry logic

### Key Improvements
- **Robust downloading**: Uses `huggingface_hub` for reliable model downloads
- **Fallback mechanism**: Ensures service works even if primary model fails
- **Better caching**: Proper cache directory configuration and permissions
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed logs for debugging model loading issues
- **Health monitoring**: Health endpoint reports model status and which model is loaded

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Service Health
```bash
curl https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "model_name": "ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2"
}
```

### 2. Test Transcription
```bash
curl -X POST "https://synapse-transcription.onrender.com/transcribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your_audio_file.oga"
```

### 3. Monitor Logs
Check the Render logs for:
- Model download progress
- Successful model loading
- Any fallback to the backup model

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Startup (Hebrew Model)
```
INFO:__main__:Starting transcription service...
INFO:__main__:Cache directory: /app/models
INFO:__main__:Primary model: ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2
INFO:__main__:Fallback model: openai/whisper-small
INFO:__main__:Attempting to load model: ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2
INFO:__main__:Model ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2 loaded successfully from cache
INFO:__main__:Service started successfully with model: ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2
```

### Fallback Scenario (English Model)
```
INFO:__main__:Starting transcription service...
INFO:__main__:Attempting to load model: ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2
WARNING:__main__:Failed to download ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2 on attempt 1: ...
INFO:__main__:Attempting to load model: openai/whisper-small
INFO:__main__:Model openai/whisper-small loaded successfully from cache
INFO:__main__:Service started successfully with model: openai/whisper-small
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the service still fails:
1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify disk space**: Ensure the 10GB disk is properly mounted
3. **Check environment variables**: Verify all cache directory variables are set
4. **Try manual redeploy**: Force a fresh deployment on Render

### If transcription quality is poor:
- The fallback model (`openai/whisper-small`) may not be as good for Hebrew
- Consider upgrading Render plan for better performance
- Monitor which model is being used via the health endpoint

## Files Modified
- `src/backend/transcription_service/app.py` - Main application with fallback logic
- `src/backend/transcription_service/requirements.txt` - Added huggingface_hub
- `src/backend/transcription_service/Dockerfile` - Improved caching and permissions
- `src/backend/transcription_service/render.yaml` - Enhanced configuration

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated transcription service
2. Test the health endpoint
3. Test actual transcription functionality
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Consider upgrading Render plan if performance is insufficient

The service should now be much more reliable and will work even if the Hebrew model is temporarily unavailable.
