4. **Add Custom Feeds**: Include niche sources for specialized content

### Managing Information Overload
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 topics and gradually add more
2. **Use Favorites**: Mark important articles to read later
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove topics you're no longer interested in
4. **Disable Feeds**: Temporarily disable feeds instead of deleting them

### Finding RSS Feeds
- **Look for RSS icons** on websites (usually in header or footer)
- **Try common URLs**: Add `/feed`, `/rss`, or `/feed.xml` to website URL
- **Check website footer**: Often has links to RSS feeds
- **Use RSS directories**: Sites like Feedly or Feedspot list RSS feeds
- **Browser extensions**: Use RSS feed finders for Chrome/Firefox

## Troubleshooting
